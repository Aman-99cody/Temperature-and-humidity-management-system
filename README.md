# Temperature-and-humidity-management-system

Involves an esp8266 chip on nodemcu platform –wifi enabled 

DHT sensor  used to detect the temperature, moisture and sent on  cloud –ThingSpeak platform 

Importance – providing moisture and temperature, for  suitable cultivation of crops, with judicious irrigation

My role – Design detection system setup along with programming it to access the data from cloud

Challenges faced –Establishment of server-cloud connectivity with microcontroller and extracting real-time data of temperature and moisture

Final outcome- Successful detection of temperature and moisture of soil and data from cloud was used for crops .
